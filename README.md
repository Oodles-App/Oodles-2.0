## Welcome to Oodles!

Oodles is an application that brings restaurants and non-profit organizations together with the common goal of eliminating food waste. Restaurant owners can use our application to donate specified food products to non-profit organizations seeking food donations. Non-profit organizations in search of specific donations can find and contact local restaurants offering those food items.

## Demoing

Our application is highly responsive, but is best viewed in mobile device dimensions (using DevTools if on a desktop).
